#For what can the digital algorithm might be used? 

After i had a second look at my results i had the idea to use this to generate Logos for a fictional company. Every employee gets his own logo wich can be used for example for business cards or other print products. In this way every employee can choose his own logo by clickung the play button as often as he wants until he finds the right one.  
For this i needed to reduce my code to bring more clearence in the generated image.
